The 4D RESTApi Component must be installed in the 4D Database, and Web Serving must be enabled.\nDetailed documentation for each service/component in this library can be found on the wiki here. Following is a quick run down of the library contents.\nThere is a step by step procedure to get started with the 4D RESTApi component and this library at this wiki page. That page will instruct you on how to get going on the 4D and Angular sides.\nInstallation\nInstall js44d library using npm, as:\nnpm install js44d --saveUsage\nThe library can be divided into three sets of components: 4D Service classes, UI widgets and a Modal Dialog Service class. The 4D Service Classes provide the interface to a 4D backend. The UI widgets are not essential, but do provide some useful UI Components that use the Services Classes. The Modal Dialog provides funcionality to open multiple floating Dialog windows, similar to Windows MDI funcionality.\nEach of the three sets are declared in a separate NgModule: FourDModule, JS44DModule and ModalModule.\nYou reference the 4D Interface Service Classes as:\nimport { FourDInterface, FourDModel, FourDCollection } from 'js44d';They need to be included in your main NgModule declaration, by importing the FourDModule.\nAs for UI components/widgets and the Modal dialog service, you reference/import them as:\nimport { ..widget.. } from 'js44d';You need to import the modules in your NgModule declaration, where you use them, as in:\n...\nimport { FourDModule, JS44DModule, ModalModule } from 'js44d';\n...\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...,\n    FourDModule, JS44DModule, ModalModule\n  ]\n  ],\n  exports: [FourDModule, JS44DModule, ModalModule],A quick note, the UI components/widgets are WEB ONLY, they do not work under Nativescript, so for {N} you can use only the 4D Service Classes. For NativeScript your module declaration should look something like this:\n...\nimport { FourDInterface, FourDModel, FourDCollection } from 'js44d';\n...\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    providers: [\n        ...,\n        FourDInterface, FourDModel, FourDCollection\n    ],\n...4D Interface Service Classes\nThe library provides a set of service classes for accessing a 4D Database backend that has the 4D RESTApi Component installed.\nFourDInterface\nThis is the base service class that implements most of the calls to 4D RESTApi.\nThe two key functions made available by this class are:\n\ncall4DRESTMethod: a wrapper function to enable calling any 4D RESTApi entry point; it automatically adds a Session Key and a hash tokens to each HTTP POST request sent to 4D, which are required by the 4D RESTApi Component; this function is used by all other services and components to send requests to 4D.\nsignin: a function that will send a REST_Authenticate sign in request to 4D and process 4D's response.\n\nThis class also provides some static variables:\n\ncurrentUser: the name of the currectly signed in user\nauthentication: the authentication response object, returned by the REST_Authenticate call (see)\nsessionKey: the current session token, that must be present in all requests to 4D\netc..\n\nFourDModel\nThis is a service class that provides CRUD functionality, acting as a Data Model base class. It provides the ability to retrieve, create, update or delete records from any 4D table.\nThis class builds upon the Data Model functionality, as described in the Data Model wiki page. \nAll 4D table's Data Models extend the FourDModel class, describing each of the table's fields and providing getter/setter for each field.\nInstances of the FourDModel class, and its extensions, represent a record in the database. This service provides basic CRUD functions to access those records:\n\ngetRecord: retrieves a single record from the database\ninsertRecord: adds a new record to the database\nupdateRecord: updates a record in the database\ndeleteRecord: deletes a record from the database\n\nAdditional functions are described in the FourDModel wiki page.\nFourDCollection\nA service class that represents a collection of 4D records. It is basically an Array of FourDModel derived instances.\nThis class provides a function to retrieve a set of records from a 4D Database:\n\ngetRecords: will take a Query String and send a REST_GetRecords request to 4D to retrieve a collection of 4D records. Record data comes as an Array of Data Model (FourDModel) instances.\n\nUI Widgets\nThe following UI widgets and components, which also interact with a 4D backend, are available for use in Angular apps. Detailed documentation for each widget is found on the wiki pages.\nLogin Component\nA basic Login dialog that takes a user name and password. It calls FourDInterface signin function, that sends a REST_Authenticate request to 4D to authenticate the given user.\n\nDatagrid Component\nThis Component provides Data Grid functionality, to display and interact with a list of records from a 4D Database.\n\nThe component is based on a KendoUI Grid widget, and displays contents of FourDModel instances, from a FourDCollection. \nQuery Band Component\nA query widget that provides functionality for querying a 4D Database, built upon a FourDModel.\n\nIt allows for a user defined query form, advanced query functionality and the ability to save and reuse queries.\nRecord List Component\nThis widget builds upon the QueryBand and DataGrid components. It associates a QueryBand to a DataGrid, so the results of a query are displayed on the associated DataGrid.\n\nAdditionally the widget provides a button bar with functionality to add/edit/delete records. It also allows for user defined custom buttons added to the button bar.\nWeb App Container Component\nThis is a Web App wrapper component, that ensures that the application component runs authenticated. If upon app initialization, it is not yet authenticated to a 4D backend, this component will display a Login dialog to get user credentials and authenticate the user.\n4D List DropDown Control\nThis is an HTML select drop down whose items are obtained directly from a 4D Choice List. One of the parameters to this widget is the choice list name.\nExample:\n  Additional Widgets/Services\nSome additional widgets/services are also part of the library, but those do not interact with 4D backends and do not depend on the 4D RESTApi.\nMDI Dialog Service\nA set of service classes that provide functionality to show multiple floating dialog windows, which can be modal or not.\n\nList Selector Dialog\nA component that presents a dialog with a list of items for user selection.\n\nTab Component\nA simple horizontal tab component, that provides functionality to allow user to tab among multiple forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
